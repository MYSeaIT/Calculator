# Project README

## Project Overview
This project involves the development of a basic calculator web application using HTML, CSS, and JavaScript. The application allows users to perform simple arithmetic operations such as addition, subtraction, multiplication, and division.

## Development Process
1. **Setting Up the HTML Structure**: Created the basic HTML structure for the calculator interface.

2. **Styling with SCSS**: Utilized SCSS to style the calculator interface, including button styling and overall layout design.

3. **Implementing JavaScript Functionality**: Wrote the JavaScript code to handle user interactions and perform the necessary calculations based on user input.

4. **Troubleshooting and Bug Fixes**: Encountered various errors during the development process and implemented solutions to resolve them.

## Encountered Errors and Solutions
1. **Error**: Display not updating correctly after calculation.
   **Solution**: Implemented a function to update the display after each calculation.

2. **Error**: Division by zero resulting in incorrect output.
   **Solution**: Added a validation check to prevent division by zero and display an error message instead.

3. **Error**: Styling inconsistencies on hover for buttons.
   **Solution**: Adjusted the SCSS code to ensure consistent hover styling for all buttons.

4. **Error**: JavaScript function not properly handling decimal inputs.
   **Solution**: Modified the input handling logic to support decimal numbers.

## Future Improvements
1. **Add Memory Functionality**: Implement memory storage for the calculator to store and retrieve previous results.
2. **Enhance User Interface**: Improve the overall user interface and add additional features for better user experience.
